<br>
🙋‍♀️**Now I Can**
- make game object move automatically
- manipulate the movement of game object: rotate, move   
<br>

📂 **'driving'** folder gives information about basic manipulation of Unity<br>

📂 **'flying'** folder is for _challenge mission_ <br>

❗ **NOTE for me** ❗   
   
Why I should use _'Vector3.forward'_  to make propeller spin around?   
Each function of _Vector3_  has information of direction.   
The assigned direction for each function is presented below.   
function | direction
-- | --
.zero | (0,0,0)
.one | (1,1,1)
.up | (0,1,0)
.down | (0,-1,0)
.right | (1,0,0)
.left | (-1,0,0)
.forward | (0,0,1)
.back | (0,0,-1)

<br>
If you are confused about how to use the function, you can enter the axis directly.<br>

🔍 **Vector3.up = Vector3(0,1,0)**
