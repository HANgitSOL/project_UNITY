# Activities in this week is following the first tutoiral provided by 'Unity'
🙌 Check this [link](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-1-driving-simulation?uv=2019.4&courseId=5cf96c41edbc2a2ca6e8810f) for original tutorial

**Now I Can**
- make game object move automatically
- manipulate the movement of game object: rotate, move

❗ **NOTE for me** ❗   
Why I should use _'Vector3.forward'_  to make propeller spin around?   
Each function of _Vector3_  has information of direction.   
The assigned direction for each function is presented below.   
function | direction
-- | --
.zero | (0,0,0)
.one | (1,1,1)
.up | (0,1,0)
.down | (0,-1,0)
.right | (1,0,0)
.left | (-1,0,0)
.forward | (0,0,1)
.back | (0,0,-1)

<br>
If you are confused about how to use the function, you can enter the axis directly.<br>

🔍 **Vector3.up = Vector3(0,1,0)**
